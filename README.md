# Team Create Ladybugs
Wanna make your Team Create appearance adorable? Well, then look no further, with the Team Create Ladybugs! Make yourself look adorable with these cute little ladybugs that are always energetic and ready to fly around!

## What is This... Repository?
This repository is the home of the source code for these ladybugs to be all yours! Get started with a simple, easy to read script that doesn't doâ€” object oriented programming?! Now, you may ask yourself "why in the heck aren't you doing OOP for this?!" Well, I don't know how to do OOP ;-; and I only used one model :p

## How to Get Set up
Once you download the **.rbxmx** file, open Roblox Studio, then drag and drop! After you do these simple steps, right click on the script, and click "Save to Local Plugin"! Type in whatever file name you want, and it'll work! Once you save the plugin, reload Studio, and boom! You're now a ladybug wherever you go! :white_heart:

## What's in This Repository?
Well, only the script, because I am a lazy girl who doesn't wanna waste time exporting everything into separate files (smh). -_-
